# Fard hub
Fard hub is an open-sourced script hub for games such as Kaiju Paradise and Jailbreak!

# Does the ui look like shit?
No, it uses the Rayfield Interface suit that has been used in thousands of scripts.

# And support?

It supports almost all executors, but the best ones are :
> Synapse X (Paid) https://x.synapse.to

> Script-ware (Paid and has support for Mac and IOS) https://script-ware.com

> KRNL (Free) https://krnl.place/

And if its not supported it should print/notify u something.
